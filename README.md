Hey! My name is Mark, and I am from the UK. I am currently an IT Apprentice, looking to get into the developer world. 
I am looking at learning C++ with my C# knowledge to potentially look at developing in UE5 in the future.
Want to look into Java also to pursue my yearlong dream of making a mod for Minecraft!
Happy to chat, add me on discord under the same username! @Mars455

My other account is: @Mars455BP[https://github.com/Mars455BP] 
This was for my A-Level, including projects such as my NEA and Student Robotics 2023 Prep
